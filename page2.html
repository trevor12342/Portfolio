    <p> I'm experienced in PLTW and CISCO. I'm also experienced in basic hacking and Coding. I got into coding by my teacher in freshmen year of highschool. He offered me a class to take for cyber security to take in junior which i took. During those classes i gained little experience in linux,cryptograhy,and wireshark.My greatest strengths are communication,open minded,and planning. What I'm working on is lacking in confindence, Disorganized,and not comfortable with public speaking.
